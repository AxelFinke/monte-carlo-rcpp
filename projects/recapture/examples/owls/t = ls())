_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     ‘par’ can be used to set or query graphical parameters.
     Parameters can be set by specifying them as arguments to ‘par’ in
     ‘tag = value’ form, or by passing them as a list of tagged values.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     par(..., no.readonly = FALSE)
     
     <highlevel plot> (..., <tag> = <value>)
     
_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

     ...: arguments in ‘tag = value’ form, or a list of tagged values.
          The tags must come from the names of graphical parameters
          described in the ‘Graphical Parameters’ section.

no.readonly: logical; if ‘TRUE’ and there are no other arguments, only
          parameters are returned which can be set by a subsequent
          ‘par()’ call _on the same device_.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     Each device has its own set of graphical parameters.  If the
     current device is the null device, ‘par’ will open a new device
     before querying/setting parameters.  (What device is controlled by
     ‘options("device")’.)

     Parameters are queried by giving one or more character vectors of
     parameter names to ‘par’.

     ‘par()’ (no arguments) or ‘par(no.readonly = TRUE)’ is used to get
     _all_ the graphical parameters (as a named list).  Their names are
     currently taken from the unexported variable ‘graphics:::.Pars’.

     _*R.O.*_ indicates _*read-only arguments*_: These may only be used
     in queries and cannot be set.  (‘"cin"’, ‘"cra"’, ‘"csi"’,
     ‘"cxy"’, ‘"din"’ and ‘"page"’ are always read-only.)

     Several parameters can only be set by a call to ‘par()’:

        • ‘"ask"’,

        • ‘"fig"’, ‘"fin"’,

        • ‘"lheight"’,

        • ‘"mai"’, ‘"mar"’, ‘"mex"’, ‘"mfcol"’, ‘"mfrow"’, ‘"mfg"’,

        • ‘"new"’,

        • ‘"oma"’, ‘"omd"’, ‘"omi"’,

        • ‘"pin"’, ‘"plt"’, ‘"ps"’, ‘"pty"’,

        • ‘"usr"’,

        • ‘"xlog"’, ‘"ylog"’,

        • ‘"ylbias"’

     The remaining parameters can also be set as arguments (often via
     ‘...’) to high-level plot functions such as ‘plot.default’,
     ‘plot.window’, ‘points’, ‘lines’, ‘abline’, ‘axis’, ‘title’,
     ‘text’, ‘mtext’, ‘segments’, ‘symbols’, ‘arrows’, ‘polygon’,
     ‘rect’, ‘box’, ‘contour’, ‘filled.contour’ and ‘image’.  Such
     settings will be active during the execution of the function,
     only.  However, see the comments on ‘bg’, ‘cex’, ‘col’, ‘lty’,
     ‘lwd’ and ‘pch’ which may be taken as _arguments_ to certain plot
     functions rather than as graphical parameters.

     The meaning of ‘character size’ is not well-defined: this is set
     up for the device taking ‘pointsize’ into account but often not
     the actual font family in use.  Internally the corresponding pars
     (‘cra’, ‘cin’, ‘cxy’ and ‘csi’) are used only to set the
     inter-line spacing used to convert ‘mar’ and ‘oma’ to physical
     margins.  (The same inter-line spacing multiplied by ‘lheight’ is
     used for multi-line strings in ‘text’ and ‘strheight’.)

     Note that graphical parameters are suggestions: plotting functions
     and devices need not make use of them (and this is particularly
     true of non-default methods for e.g. ‘plot’).

_V_a_l_u_e:

     When parameters are set, their previous values are returned in an
     invisible named list.  Such a list can be passed as an argument to
     ‘par’ to restore the parameter values.  Use ‘par(no.readonly =
     TRUE)’ for the full list of parameters that can be restored.
     However, restoring all of these is not wise: see the ‘Note’
     section.

     When just one parameter is queried, the value of that parameter is
     returned as (atomic) vector.  When two or more parameters are
     queried, their values are returned in a list, with the list names
     giving the parameters.

     Note the inconsistency: setting one parameter returns a list, but
     querying one parameter returns a vector.

_G_r_a_p_h_i_c_a_l _P_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r_s:

     ‘adj’ The value of ‘adj’ determines the way in which text strings
          are justified in ‘text’, ‘mtext’ and ‘title’.  A value of ‘0’
          produces left-justified text, ‘0.5’ (the default) centered
          text and ‘1’ right-justified text.  (Any value in [0, 1] is
          allowed, and on most devices values outside that interval
          will also work.)

          Note that the ‘adj’ _argument_ of ‘text’ also allows ‘adj =
          c(x, y)’ for different adjustment in x- and y- directions.
          Note that whereas for ‘text’ it refers to positioning of text
          about a point, for ‘mtext’ and ‘title’ it controls placement
          within the plot or device region.

     ‘ann’ If set to ‘FALSE’, high-level plotting functions calling
          ‘plot.default’ do not annotate the plots they produce with
          axis titles and overall titles.  The default is to do
          annotation.

     ‘ask’ logical.  If ‘TRUE’ (and the R session is interactive) the
          user is asked for input, before a new figure is drawn.  As
          this applies to the device, it also affects output by
          packages ‘grid’ and ‘lattice’.  It can be set even on
          non-screen devices but may have no effect there.

          This not really a graphics parameter, and its use is
          deprecated in favour of ‘devAskNewPage’.

     ‘bg’ The color to be used for the background of the device region.
          When called from ‘par()’ it also sets ‘new = FALSE’. See
          section ‘Color Specification’ for suitable values.  For many
          devices the initial value is set from the ‘bg’ argument of
          the device, and for the rest it is normally ‘"white"’.

          Note that some graphics functions such as ‘plot.default’ and
          ‘points’ have an _argument_ of this name with a different
          meaning.

     ‘bty’ A character string which determined the type of ‘box’ which
          is drawn about plots.  If ‘bty’ is one of ‘"o"’ (the
          default), ‘"l"’, ‘"7"’, ‘"c"’, ‘"u"’, or ‘"]"’ the resulting
          box resembles the corresponding upper case letter.  A value
          of ‘"n"’ suppresses the box.

     ‘cex’ A numerical value giving the amount by which plotting text
          and symbols should be magnified relative to the default.
          This starts as ‘1’ when a device is opened, and is reset when
          the layout is changed, e.g. by setting ‘mfrow’.

          Note that some graphics functions such as ‘plot.default’ have
          an _argument_ of this name which _multiplies_ this graphical
          parameter, and some functions such as ‘points’ and ‘text’
          accept a vector of values which are recycled.

     ‘cex.axis’ The magnification to be used for axis annotation
          relative to the current setting of ‘cex’.

     ‘cex.lab’ The magnification to be used for x and y labels relative
          to the current setting of ‘cex’.

     ‘cex.main’ The magnification to be used for main titles relative
          to the current setting of ‘cex’.

     ‘cex.sub’ The magnification to be used for sub-titles relative to
          the current setting of ‘cex’.

     ‘cin’ _*R.O.*_; character size ‘(width, height)’ in inches.  These
          are the same measurements as ‘cra’, expressed in different
          units.

     ‘col’ A specification for the default plotting color.  See section
          ‘Color Specification’.

          Some functions such as ‘lines’ and ‘text’ accept a vector of
          values which are recycled and may be interpreted slightly
          differently.

     ‘col.axis’ The color to be used for axis annotation.  Defaults to
          ‘"black"’.

     ‘col.lab’ The color to be used for x and y labels.  Defaults to
          ‘"black"’.

     ‘col.main’ The color to be used for plot main titles.  Defaults to
          ‘"black"’.

     ‘col.sub’ The color to be used for plot sub-titles.  Defaults to
          ‘"black"’.

     ‘cra’ _*R.O.*_; size of default character ‘(width, height)’ in
          ‘rasters’ (pixels).  Some devices have no concept of pixels
          and so assume an arbitrary pixel size, usually 1/72 inch.
          These are the same measurements as ‘cin’, expressed in
          different units.

     ‘crt’ A numerical value specifying (in degrees) how single
          characters should be rotated.  It is unwise to expect values
          other than multiples of 90 to work.  Compare with ‘srt’ which
          does string rotation.

     ‘csi’ _*R.O.*_; height of (default-sized) characters in inches.
          The same as ‘par("cin")[2]’.

     ‘cxy’ _*R.O.*_; size of default character ‘(width, height)’ in
          user coordinate units.  ‘par("cxy")’ is
          ‘par("cin")/par("pin")’ scaled to user coordinates.  Note
          that ‘c(strwidth(ch), strheight(ch))’ for a given string ‘ch’
          is usually much more precise.

     ‘din’ _*R.O.*_; the device dimensions, ‘(width, height)’, in
          inches.  See also ‘dev.size’, which is updated immediately
          when an on-screen device windows is re-sized.

     ‘err’ (_Unimplemented_; R is silent when points outside the plot
          region are _not_ plotted.)  The degree of error reporting
          desired.

     ‘family’ The name of a font family for drawing text.  The maximum
          allowed length is 200 bytes.  This name gets mapped by each
          graphics device to a device-specific font description.  The
          default value is ‘""’ which means that the default device
          fonts will be used (and what those are should be listed on
          the help page for the device).  Standard values are
          ‘"serif"’, ‘"sans"’ and ‘"mono"’, and the Hershey font
          families are also available.  (Different devices may define
          others, and some devices will ignore this setting
          completely.)  This can be specified inline for ‘text’.

     ‘fg’ The color to be used for the foreground of plots.  This is
          the default color used for things like axes and boxes around
          plots.  When called from ‘par()’ this also sets parameter
          ‘col’ to the same value.  See section ‘Color Specification’.
          A few devices have an argument to set the initial value,
          which is otherwise ‘"black"’.

     ‘fig’ A numerical vector of the form ‘c(x1, x2, y1, y2)’ which
          gives the (NDC) coordinates of the figure region in the
          display region of the device. If you set this, unlike S, you
          start a new plot, so to add to an existing plot use ‘new =
          TRUE’ as well.

     ‘fin’ The figure region dimensions, ‘(width, height)’, in inches.
          If you set this, unlike S, you start a new plot.

     ‘font’ An integer which specifies which font to use for text.  If
          possible, device drivers arrange so that 1 corresponds to
          plain text (the default), 2 to bold face, 3 to italic and 4
          to bold italic.  Also, font 5 is expected to be the symbol
          font, in Adobe symbol encoding.  On some devices font
          families can be selected by ‘family’ to choose different sets
          of 5 fonts.

     ‘font.axis’ The font to be used for axis annotation.

     ‘font.lab’ The font to be used for x and y labels.

     ‘font.main’ The font to be used for plot main titles.

     ‘font.sub’ The font to be used for plot sub-titles.

     ‘lab’ A numerical vector of the form ‘c(x, y, len)’ which modifies
          the default way that axes are annotated.  The values of ‘x’
          and ‘y’ give the (approximate) number of tickmarks on the x
          and y axes and ‘len’ specifies the label length.  The default
          is ‘c(5, 5, 7)’.  Note that this only affects the way the
          parameters ‘xaxp’ and ‘yaxp’ are set when the user coordinate
          system is set up, and is not consulted when axes are drawn.
          ‘len’ _is unimplemented_ in R.

     ‘las’ numeric in {0,1,2,3}; the style of axis labels.

          0: always parallel to the axis [_default_],

          1: always horizontal,

          2: always perpendicular to the axis,

          3: always vertical.

          Also supported by ‘mtext’.  Note that string/character
          rotation _via_ argument ‘srt’ to ‘par’ does _not_ affect the
          axis labels.

     ‘lend’ The line end style.  This can be specified as an integer or
          string:

          ‘0’ and ‘"round"’ mean rounded line caps [_default_];

          ‘1’ and ‘"butt"’ mean butt line caps;

          ‘2’ and ‘"square"’ mean square line caps.

     ‘lheight’ The line height multiplier.  The height of a line of
          text (used to vertically space multi-line text) is found by
          multiplying the character height both by the current
          character expansion and by the line height multiplier.
          Default value is 1.  Used in ‘text’ and ‘strheight’.

     ‘ljoin’ The line join style.  This can be specified as an integer
          or string:

          ‘0’ and ‘"round"’ mean rounded line joins [_default_];

          ‘1’ and ‘"mitre"’ mean mitred line joins;

          ‘2’ and ‘"bevel"’ mean bevelled line joins.

     ‘lmitre’ The line mitre limit.  This controls when mitred line
          joins are automatically converted into bevelled line joins.
          The value must be larger than 1 and the default is 10.  Not
          all devices will honour this setting.

     ‘lty’ The line type.  Line types can either be specified as an
          integer (0=blank, 1=solid (default), 2=dashed, 3=dotted,
          4=dotdash, 5=longdash, 6=twodash) or as one of the character
          strings ‘"blank"’, ‘"solid"’, ‘"dashed"’, ‘"dotted"’,
          ‘"dotdash"’, ‘"longdash"’, or ‘"twodash"’, where ‘"blank"’
          uses ‘invisible lines’ (i.e., does not draw them).

          Alternatively, a string of up to 8 characters (from ‘c(1:9,
          "A":"F")’) may be given, giving the length of line segments
          which are alternatively drawn and skipped.  See section ‘Line
          Type Specification’.

          Functions such as ‘lines’ and ‘segments’ accept a vector of
          values which are recycled.

     ‘lwd’ The line width, a _positive_ number, defaulting to ‘1’.  The
          interpretation is device-specific, and some devices do not
          implement line widths less than one.  (See the help on the
          device for details of the interpretation.)

          Functions such as ‘lines’ and ‘segments’ accept a vector of
          values which are recycled: in such uses lines corresponding
          to values ‘NA’ or ‘NaN’ are omitted.  The interpretation of
          ‘0’ is device-specific.

     ‘mai’ A numerical vector of the form ‘c(bottom, left, top, right)’
          which gives the margin size specified in inches.

     ‘mar’ A numerical vector of the form ‘c(bottom, left, top, right)’
          which gives the number of lines of margin to be specified on
          the four sides of the plot.  The default is ‘c(5, 4, 4, 2) +
          0.1’.

     ‘mex’ ‘mex’ is a character size expansion factor which is used to
          describe coordinates in the margins of plots. Note that this
          does not change the font size, rather specifies the size of
          font (as a multiple of ‘csi’) used to convert between ‘mar’
          and ‘mai’, and between ‘oma’ and ‘omi’.

          This starts as ‘1’ when the device is opened, and is reset
          when the layout is changed (alongside resetting ‘cex’).

     ‘mfcol, mfrow’ A vector of the form ‘c(nr, nc)’.  Subsequent
          figures will be drawn in an ‘nr’-by-‘nc’ array on the device
          by _columns_ (‘mfcol’), or _rows_ (‘mfrow’), respectively.

          In a layout with exactly two rows and columns the base value
          of ‘"cex"’ is reduced by a factor of 0.83: if there are three
          or more of either rows or columns, the reduction factor is
          0.66.

          Setting a layout resets the base value of ‘cex’ and that of
          ‘mex’ to ‘1’.

          If either of these is queried it will give the current
          layout, so querying cannot tell you the order in which the
          array will be filled.

          Consider the alternatives, ‘layout’ and ‘split.screen’.

     ‘mfg’ A numerical vector of the form ‘c(i, j)’ where ‘i’ and ‘j’
          indicate which figure in an array of figures is to be drawn
          next (if setting) or is being drawn (if enquiring).  The
          array must already have been set by ‘mfcol’ or ‘mfrow’.

          For compatibility with S, the form ‘c(i, j, nr, nc)’ is also
          accepted, when ‘nr’ and ‘nc’ should be the current number of
          rows and number of columns.  Mismatches will be ignored, with
          a warning.

     ‘mgp’ The margin line (in ‘mex’ units) for the axis title, axis
          labels and axis line.  Note that ‘mgp[1]’ affects ‘title’
          whereas ‘mgp[2:3]’ affect ‘axis’.  The default is ‘c(3, 1,
          0)’.

     ‘mkh’ The height in inches of symbols to be drawn when the value
          of ‘pch’ is an integer. _Completely ignored in R_.

     ‘new’ logical, defaulting to ‘FALSE’.  If set to ‘TRUE’, the next
          high-level plotting command (actually ‘plot.new’) should _not
          clean_ the frame before drawing _as if it were on a *_new_*
          device_.  It is an error (ignored with a warning) to try to
          use ‘new = TRUE’ on a device that does not currently contain
          a high-level plot.

     ‘oma’ A vector of the form ‘c(bottom, left, top, right)’ giving
          the size of the outer margins in lines of text.

     ‘omd’ A vector of the form ‘c(x1, x2, y1, y2)’ giving the region
          _inside_ outer margins in NDC (= normalized device
          coordinates), i.e., as a fraction (in [0, 1]) of the device
          region.

     ‘omi’ A vector of the form ‘c(bottom, left, top, right)’ giving
          the size of the outer margins in inches.

     ‘page’ _*R.O.*_; A boolean value indicating whether the next call
          to ‘plot.new’ is going to start a new page.  This value may
          be ‘FALSE’ if there are multiple figures on the page.

     ‘pch’ Either an integer specifying a symbol or a single character
          to be used as the default in plotting points.  See ‘points’
          for possible values and their interpretation.  Note that only
          integers and single-character strings can be set as a
          graphics parameter (and not ‘NA’ nor ‘NULL’).

          Some functions such as ‘points’ accept a vector of values
          which are recycled.

     ‘pin’ The current plot dimensions, ‘(width, height)’, in inches.

     ‘plt’ A vector of the form ‘c(x1, x2, y1, y2)’ giving the
          coordinates of the plot region as fractions of the current
          figure region.

     ‘ps’ integer; the point size of text (but not symbols).  Unlike
          the ‘pointsize’ argument of most devices, this does not
          change the relationship between ‘mar’ and ‘mai’ (nor ‘oma’
          and ‘omi’).

          What is meant by ‘point size’ is device-specific, but most
          devices mean a multiple of 1bp, that is 1/72 of an inch.

     ‘pty’ A character specifying the type of plot region to be used;
          ‘"s"’ generates a square plotting region and ‘"m"’ generates
          the maximal plotting region.

     ‘smo’ (_Unimplemented_) a value which indicates how smooth circles
          and circular arcs should be.

     ‘srt’ The string rotation in degrees.  See the comment about
          ‘crt’.  Only supported by ‘text’.

     ‘tck’ The length of tick marks as a fraction of the smaller of the
          width or height of the plotting region.  If ‘tck >= 0.5’ it
          is interpreted as a fraction of the relevant side, so if ‘tck
          = 1’ grid lines are drawn.  The default setting (‘tck = NA’)
          is to use ‘tcl = -0.5’.

     ‘tcl’ The length of tick marks as a fraction of the height of a
          line of text.  The default value is ‘-0.5’; setting ‘tcl =
          NA’ sets ‘tck = -0.01’ which is S' default.

     ‘usr’ A vector of the form ‘c(x1, x2, y1, y2)’ giving the extremes
          of the user coordinates of the plotting region.  When a
          logarithmic scale is in use (i.e., ‘par("xlog")’ is true, see
          below), then the x-limits will be ‘10 ^ par("usr")[1:2]’.
          Similarly for the y-axis.

     ‘xaxp’ A vector of the form ‘c(x1, x2, n)’ giving the coordinates
          of the extreme tick marks and the number of intervals between
          tick-marks when ‘par("xlog")’ is false.  Otherwise, when
          _log_ coordinates are active, the three values have a
          different meaning: For a small range, ‘n’ is _negative_, and
          the ticks are as in the linear case, otherwise, ‘n’ is in
          ‘1:3’, specifying a case number, and ‘x1’ and ‘x2’ are the
          lowest and highest power of 10 inside the user coordinates,
          ‘10 ^ par("usr")[1:2]’. (The ‘"usr"’ coordinates are
          log10-transformed here!)

          n = 1 will produce tick marks at 10^j for integer j,

          n = 2 gives marks k 10^j with k in {1,5},

          n = 3 gives marks k 10^j with k in {1,2,5}.

          See ‘axTicks()’ for a pure R implementation of this.

          This parameter is reset when a user coordinate system is set
          up, for example by starting a new page or by calling
          ‘plot.window’ or setting ‘par("usr")’: ‘n’ is taken from
          ‘par("lab")’.  It affects the default behaviour of subsequent
          calls to ‘axis’ for sides 1 or 3.

          It is only relevant to default numeric axis systems, and not
          for example to dates.

     ‘xaxs’ The style of axis interval calculation to be used for the
          x-axis.  Possible values are ‘"r"’, ‘"i"’, ‘"e"’, ‘"s"’,
          ‘"d"’.  The styles are generally controlled by the range of
          data or ‘xlim’, if given.
          Style ‘"r"’ (regular) first extends the data range by 4
          percent at each end and then finds an axis with pretty labels
          that fits within the extended range.
          Style ‘"i"’ (internal) just finds an axis with pretty labels
          that fits within the original data range.
          Style ‘"s"’ (standard) finds an axis with pretty labels
          within which the original data range fits.
          Style ‘"e"’ (extended) is like style ‘"s"’, except that it is
          also ensures that there is room for plotting symbols within
          the bounding box.
          Style ‘"d"’ (direct) specifies that the current axis should
          be used on subsequent plots.
          (_Only ‘"r"’ and ‘"i"’ styles have been implemented in R._)

     ‘xaxt’ A character which specifies the x axis type.  Specifying
          ‘"n"’ suppresses plotting of the axis.  The standard value is
          ‘"s"’: for compatibility with S values ‘"l"’ and ‘"t"’ are
          accepted but are equivalent to ‘"s"’: any value other than
          ‘"n"’ implies plotting.

     ‘xlog’ A logical value (see ‘log’ in ‘plot.default’).  If ‘TRUE’,
          a logarithmic scale is in use (e.g., after ‘plot(*, log =
          "x")’).  For a new device, it defaults to ‘FALSE’, i.e.,
          linear scale.

     ‘xpd’ A logical value or ‘NA’.  If ‘FALSE’, all plotting is
          clipped to the plot region, if ‘TRUE’, all plotting is
          clipped to the figure region, and if ‘NA’, all plotting is
          clipped to the device region.  See also ‘clip’.

     ‘yaxp’ A vector of the form ‘c(y1, y2, n)’ giving the coordinates
          of the extreme tick marks and the number of intervals between
          tick-marks unless for log coordinates, see ‘xaxp’ above.

     ‘yaxs’ The style of axis interval calculation to be used for the
          y-axis.  See ‘xaxs’ above.

     ‘yaxt’ A character which specifies the y axis type.  Specifying
          ‘"n"’ suppresses plotting.

     ‘ylbias’ A positive real value used in the positioning of text in
          the margins by ‘axis’ and ‘mtext’.  The default is in
          principle device-specific, but currently ‘0.2’ for all of R's
          own devices.  Set this to ‘0.2’ for compatibility with R <
          2.14.0 on ‘x11’ and ‘windows()’ devices.

     ‘ylog’ A logical value; see ‘xlog’ above.

     Colors can be specified in several different ways. The simplest
     way is with a character string giving the color name (e.g.,
     ‘"red"’).  A list of the possible colors can be obtained with the
     function ‘colors’.  Alternatively, colors can be specified
     directly in terms of their RGB components with a string of the
     form ‘"#RRGGBB"’ where each of the pairs ‘RR’, ‘GG’, ‘BB’ consist
     of two hexadecimal digits giving a value in the range ‘00’ to
     ‘FF’.  Colors can also be specified by giving an index into a
     small table of colors, the ‘palette’: indices wrap round so with
     the default palette of size 8, ‘10’ is the same as ‘2’.  This
     provides compatibility with S.  Index ‘0’ corresponds to the
     background color.  Note that the palette (apart from ‘0’ which is
     per-device) is a per-session setting.

     Negative integer colours were accepted prior to R 3.0.0, but
     treated inconsistently.  They are now errors.

     Additionally, ‘"transparent"’ is _transparent_, useful for filled
     areas (such as the background!), and just invisible for things
     like lines or text.  In most circumstances (integer) ‘NA’ is
     equivalent to ‘"transparent"’ (but not for ‘text’ and ‘mtext’).

     Semi-transparent colors are available for use on devices that
     support them.

     The functions ‘rgb’, ‘hsv’, ‘hcl’, ‘gray’ and ‘rainbow’ provide
     additional ways of generating colors.

     It was possible to specify color numbers as strings prior to R
     3.0.0.

_L_i_n_e _T_y_p_e _S_p_e_c_i_f_i_c_a_t_i_o_n:

     Line types can either be specified by giving an index into a small
     built-in table of line types (1 = solid, 2 = dashed, etc, see
     ‘lty’ above) or directly as the lengths of on/off stretches of
     line.  This is done with a string of an even number (up to eight)
     of characters, namely _non-zero_ (hexadecimal) digits which give
     the lengths in consecutive positions in the string.  For example,
     the string ‘"33"’ specifies three units on followed by three off
     and ‘"3313"’ specifies three units on followed by three off
     followed by one on and finally three off.  The ‘units’ here are
     (on most devices) proportional to ‘lwd’, and with ‘lwd = 1’ are in
     pixels or points or 1/96 inch.

     The five standard dash-dot line types (‘lty = 2:6’) correspond to
     ‘c("44", "13", "1343", "73", "2262")’.

     Note that ‘NA’ is not a valid value for ‘lty’.

     The effect of restoring all the (settable) graphics parameters as
     in the examples is hard to predict if the device has been resized.
     Several of them are attempting to set the same things in different
     ways, and those last in the alphabet will win.  In particular, the
     settings of ‘mai’, ‘mar’, ‘pin’, ‘plt’ and ‘pty’ interact, as do
     the outer margin settings, the figure layout and figure region
     size.
